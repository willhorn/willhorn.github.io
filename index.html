    <p>Welcome! Thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <p>In April, 2016 I decided to start on a focused learning path. I've been taking massive online open courses (MOOCs) for
    several years now, but there has not been a common thread or goal tying the courses together. Furthermore, the classes did not
    inspire much work beyond the requirements for course completion.</p>
    <p>My current long-term goal is to complete a website I've been thinking about for a couple of years. To build the skills
    necessary to achieve this goal, I'll be doing coursework and small side projects. You can track my progress on the <a href=
    "goals.html">goals page</a>. You can also see the results of some of my side projects in the blog section.</p>
    <p>The primary purpose of this site is to serve as a reference for myself and those encouraging me on this journey, but I hope
    others find some value in it as well.</p>
