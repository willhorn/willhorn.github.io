      <h1>Check Assumptions</h1>
      <p>I learned this lesson (again) last night. I've been using <a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy">Scrapy</a> to create
      a spider with the goal of gathering data from <a href="http://www.c-uphd.org/food-inspection-reports.html">CUPHD's health
      inspection reports database</a>. Inspection reports are grouped by facility and can be found via two different search
      mechanisms. The endpoint for both is http://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/search.cfm. The first mechanism allows for
      searches by the first character in the name of the facility. In other words, I could search for all facilities beginning with
      the letter 'A'. The second, more advanced search mechanism includes several fields. Among them are the start and end date,
      which represent an inspection date range. They default to the entire available range, which is January 1, 2008 to present.
      They are passed as the GET parameters <code>sd</code> and <code>ed</code> in the format MM/DD/YYYY.</p>
      <p>My primary focus thus far has been the initial crawl, which will traverse all inspections in the database to-date. I've
      know since beginning that I'll eventually want a cron job to periodically check for new reports and add them to my dataset.
      The second search mechanism lends itself well to an incremental crawl by date, and I knew I could <a href=
      "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#spider-arguments">easily pass parameters to my Scrapy spider</a>. As
      long as I used the advanced search mechanism during development, I assumed I'd be in a good place to parameterize the crawler
      later.</p>
      <p>Last night I was ready to parameterize the crawler. After completing my changes locally, I began testing. I quickly
      discovered that the inspection start and end dates did not work as expected -- perhaps not all. I knew from early testing
      that facility 587 had an inspection on February 26, 2008. So I set the start date to January 1, 2008 and the end date to
      January 1, 2009. I expected that report and likely a few others to be found. No reports were found. I could see the request
      made by the crawler in the logs. I pasted the request into my browser. No results. Finally, thinking I may have formatted the
      dates or URL incorrectly, I used the database's UI to enter the inspection date range and run the search. Still no
      results.</p>
      <p>I tried several more date ranges using the UI. It's clear that it's doing some filtering, but I haven't found a pattern.
      My plan at this point is to check if the date parameters work as expected for recent inspections. That's all I need for the
      incremental crawls to work anyway. If they don't, I won't have a reliable way of knowing whether or not a facility has had an
      inspection since the last crawl, and I'll need to the crawler to visit every facility page to check for links to recent
      inspection reports.</p>
