      <h1>Check Assumptions</h1>
      <p>I learned this lesson (again) last night. I've been using <a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy">Scrapy</a> to create
      a spider with the goal of gathering data from <a href="http://www.c-uphd.org/food-inspection-reports.html">CUPHD's health
      inspection reports database</a>. Inspection reports are grouped by facility and can be found via two different search
      mechanisms. The endpoint for both is http://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/search.cfm. The first mechanism allows for
      searches by the first character in the name of the facility. In other words, I could search for all facilities beginning with
      the letter 'A'. The second, more advanced search mechanism includes several fields. Among them are the start and end date,
      which represent an inspection date range. They default to the entire...</p>

      <h1>Logo Design</h1>
      <p>The design of the logo on this site is based on a "William" logo I created in a high school class using AutoCAD. I tried
      using several different design applications including Pixelmator, Assembly (iOS), and a couple of other iPhone apps. I
      ultimately decided to use Wolfram Language for its mathematical precision.</p>
      <p>The desired properties of the logo were that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>the logo be contained within a perfect square,</li>
        <li>the top left corner of the enclosing square intersect with the right-most boundary of the left-most portion of the
        "W",</li>
        <li>the "W" be perfectly centered,</li>
        <li>the "dot" on the "i" be a perfect square,</li>
        <li>all segments of the "W" have the same width <code>δ</code>,</li>
        <li>the distance between the "dot" and the base of the "i" <code>i</code> be less than or equal to <code>δ</code>, and</li>
        <li>all segments...</li>
      </ol>
